The goal is to use arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on the six numbers to reach the target number. The challenge lies in the constraints: each of the six numbers can be used at most once, and operations must result in whole numbers.\n",

This will likely include generating combinations of numbers and operations, evaluating these combinations against the target number, and optimizing the search for solutions. Utilizing Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) for efficient evaluation of mathematical expressions will be a key part of the strategy.\n",
