    "### Game Rules\n",
    "The Countdown Numbers Game is an exercise in numerical agility, where contestants must reach a target number using a combination of six chosen numbers through basic arithmetic operations. This game emphasizes precision and strategic thinking, adhering to rules that enforce single-use and whole number results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number Selection**: Each contestant is given six numbers, chosen randomly from a predefined set. This set includes two groups of numbers:\n",
    "  - Small numbers: Two sets of the integers from 1 to 10.\n",
    "  - Large numbers: One set of the numbers 25, 50, 75, and 100.\n",
    "- **Target Number**: A random target number is generated, ranging from 101 to 999.\n",
    "- **Objective**: Using the six chosen numbers and the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), contestants must reach the target number, or get as close as possible within 30 seconds.\n",
    "- **Constraints**:\n",
    "  - Each of the six numbers can be used at most once in the calculation.\n",
    "  - Operations must result in whole numbers. Fractions are not allowed.\n",
    "  - Only positive results are allowed for subtraction operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules require a careful choice and arrangement of actions, testing participants' capacity to strategize in stressful situations and adjust to the arithmetic constraints presented."

    "\n",
    "The Countdown Numbers Game is a mix of math puzzles and strategy. Looking throught the lens of Simon Colton's work reveals how deeply this game dives into mathematical and computational concepts. It challenges players to find solutions within a tight set of rules, using a mix of counting and arranging, algorithmic search techniques, and understanding the complexity of computations. Colton's approach to finding the best solutions for millions of these puzzles highlights the game's complexity and how it bridges the gap between human thinking and computer algorithms. "

    "\n",
    "1. **Generating Possible Solutions**: Exploring the space of possible arithmetic operations that can be performed with the given numbers.\n",
    "2. **Evaluating Solutions**: Assessing each potential solution to determine if it meets the target number or comes closest to it.\n",
    "3. **Optimizing Performance**: Considering the computational complexity of the problem, finding efficient algorithms is crucial to solving the game within a reasonable time frame."

    "### Theoretical Framework\n",
    "This section looks into the theoretical concepts and computational procedures that form the foundation of our approach to solving the Countdown Numbers Game. Understanding these models aids in creating efficient algorithms and clarifies the computational reasoning involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Models of Computation:\n",
    "**1. Reverse Polish Notation (RPN):** RPN is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands, eliminating the need for parentheses that are required by infix notation. Applying RPN in solving the Countdown game simplifies the computation process, as it allows for the direct evaluation of expressions using a stack-based approach. This model is particularly effective in environments that support stack operations, facilitating straightforward arithmetic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Infix Notation:** Infix notation, on the other hand, puts operators between operands. It is easier for humans to understand, but computers need more complicated parsing algorithms to evaluate it. Understanding and using this can make interfaces easier for people to use where expressions are typed in normally but are handled quickly in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Functional Programming:** This approach focuses on using functions that don't change state or changeable data, which makes it perfect for handling the Countdown game's complex state-dependent calculations. Focusing on pure functions helps ensure that the solution tool has no side effects, which makes testing and debugging easier. Functional programming also makes high-level operations like map and reduce easier. These operations elegantly describe making combinations and comparing them to the goal number.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding these models, the algorithm not only works better, it also becomes more stable and easy to keep, so it can handle the Countdown Numbers Game's many changing challenges. We'll see how these models help handle and improve the problem-solving process as we look into how hard it is to compute."

    "#### Computational Complexity of the Game\n",
    "The Countdown Numbers Game's complexity is significant due to its similarities with the NP-hard subset sum problem . This complexity comes from the need to investigate several number and operation combinations in order to get a desired number.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computational theory, a subset sum problem is an NP-hard problem if it is as tricky as the most complex problems in NP and there isn't an effective solution for every scenario. This illustrates the difficulty of such challenges by being similar to the Countdown challenge, in which participants use particular numbers and processes to attain an objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Brute Force Approach:** The simplest approach would assess each possible combination of operations between the selected numbers. The more numbers or operations added, the more computationally demanding this strategy becomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optimized Techniques:** Algorithms can use techniques like backtracking to remove unfavourable paths and strategic rules to rank operations in order of potential speed at which the goal number can be reached to manage complexity efficiently.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Practical Efficiency:** Balancing computational complexity with practical execution times is essential. Techniques such as memoization or dynamic programming optimize calculations by storing intermediate results for reuse, thereby enhancing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the computational complexity is important as it influences algorithm design, ensuring that the algorithms are both successful and efficient. It draws attention to the need for calculated strategic adjustments that reduce the difficulty of playing the Countdown game to a manageable task with realistic time constraints. As we move forward, these insights will guide the development of the solve_numbers function, ensuring it is both theoretically sound but also practically viable."
