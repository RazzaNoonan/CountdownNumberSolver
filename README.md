**4th Year Computational Theory Repo**

### Assessment for Computational Theory Module
The Computational Theory assessment is designed to evaluate students understanding and ability to apply computational theory concepts. This project constitutes 100% of the module marks, with a deadline set for Tuesday, 30 April 2024.

### Purpose
This project aims to assess the ability to:
- Identify challenging computational problems in everyday computing.
- Define common models of computation.
- Design computer programs using various computational paradigms.
- Analyse the complexity of algorithms.

### Topic
The project involves analyzing and solving the numbers round of the TV program Countdown. The objective is to develop a Python function that finds a solution to reach a target number using given numbers and arithmetic operations, adhering to specific game rules.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): For cloning and version control.
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/): To run the code snippets.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): To edit and run the project.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/): Python is required to run the scripts. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or newer.
- [tracemalloc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html): This is a Python library used for tracking memory allocation. It is part of the Python standard library.
- [psutil](https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): This library is used for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors). Install it using pip:


### Getting Started'
1. Install prerequisite 
2. Clone the repository
clone this repository and navigate into it, run the following commands in your terminal:

_git clone [https://github.com/RazzaNoonan/CountdownNumberSolver.git] <br>
cd CountdownProject_

## Contents
- **countdown.ipynb**: Contains all work related to the Countdown numbers game, including theory, implementation, and presentation elements.
- **solution_log.txt**: The solution file logs outcomes for different target numbers, recording either "No solution found" or "Solution found" with the corresponding mathematical expression for each target.

## Usage
To run the project, open the `countdown.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda or Jupyter Lab:
