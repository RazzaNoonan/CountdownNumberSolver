**4th Year Computational Theory Repo**

### Assessment for Computational Theory Module
The Computational Theory assessment is designed to evaluate students understanding and ability to apply computational theory concepts. This project constitutes 100% of the module marks, with a deadline set for Tuesday, 30 April 2024.

### Purpose
This project aims to assess the ability to:

Identify challenging computational problems in everyday computing.
Define common models of computation.
Design computer programs using various computational paradigms.
Analyse the complexity of algorithms.

### Topic
The project involves analyzing and solving the numbers round of the TV program Countdown. The objective is to develop a Python function that finds a solution to reach a target number using given numbers and arithmetic operations, adhering to specific game rules.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

* <a href="https://github.com/">Git:</a> For cloning and version control.
* <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda:</a>To run the code snippets.
* <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code:</a> To run the project
